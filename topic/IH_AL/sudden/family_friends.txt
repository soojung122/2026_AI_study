One of your relatives is going on vacation, and their house will be
empty. You have agreed to take care of his or her duties at home while
they are gone on the trip. Make a call to your relatives and ask 3 or 4
questions about what you have to do for them.

You just arrived at your relative’s home. But you can’t get into the
house because the door is locked, and you can’t find the key. Contact
your relatives, and leave a message explaining the situation. And offer
2 or 3 ways to solve the problem.

Tell me a memorable experience that you couldn’t keep a promise to your
family or friend, or had to cancel an appointment. What happened? What
was the reason you couldn’t keep a promise? How did you deal with the
situation?
