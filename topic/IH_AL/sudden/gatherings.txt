Tell me about gatherings or celebrations in your country. How do people
have them? Is it at someone’s home or a park or somewhere else? What do
they do when they get together.

Have you helped prepare for a party or a celebration? Maybe you helped
invite people, decorate a room, or get the food or drinks. Please tell
me what you did for the party or the celebration in detail.

Tell me about the last gathering or celebration you attended recently.
What was the occasion? What did you do there and who did you go with?
Tell me about what happened from beginning to end.
