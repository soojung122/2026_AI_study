Tell me about your favorite piece of furniture in your house. What
furniture do you have? What does it look like, and what do you like
about the furniture? Describe it in detail.

Tell me about the furniture you had in your childhood home. What kinds
of furniture did you have? How was it different from the furniture you
have now?

Have you ever had any problems with your furniture? Was it broken, or
did it get stained or ripped? What happened? How did you solve this
problem? Tell me everything from beginning to end.
