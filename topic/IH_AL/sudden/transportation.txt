I would like to know about public transportation in your country. What
kind of transportation do people use to get around? Do you use public
transportation, or do you drive? Which one do you prefer to take and
why?

When was the last time you took a different type of transportation than
usual? What happened? Where were you going? Tell me about the memorable
experience in detail.

Sometimes, riding the subway or bus can be uncomfortable. Have you ever
had any problems related to transportation? What was the problem, and
how did you deal with the situation?
