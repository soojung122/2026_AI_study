What kinds of technology do you use most often? Is it your computer or
cell phone? Or any other handheld device? What is it, and why do you use
it? Provide as many details as possible.

Please compare the present technology with past technology. What are the
differences between them, and how have they affected? How has technology
changed over time?

Problems often come up related to technologies. Tell me about an
experience you had when you used technology. Was it not working
properly, or was there anything trouble with them? What happened? And
how did you solve the problem?
