You indicated in the survey that you like listening to music. What types

Tell me about a particular time when you went to listen to some live
music. Did you go to concerts or a live café? What did you do there, and
what happened? What made this experience memorable?

How did you first become interested in listening to music? What kind of
music did you listen to when you were young? What was your favorite
song? And how has your taste in music changed over time?
