Now you want to buy two tickets to a concert. Call a theater, and ask 3
or 4 questions about how to purchase the tickets.

You bought the concert tickets, and were supposed to go to that concert
with your friend. But you are very sick at the last minute. Call your
friend, explain the situation, and suggest 2 or 3 alternatives.

Have you ever experienced something similar in that you bought concert
tickets, or made any other plans but had to cancel at the last minute
because something came up? What was the problem, and how did you solve
the problem? Tell me what happened in detail.
