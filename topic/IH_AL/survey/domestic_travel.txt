I’d like to know about places people like to travel to for their
vacations. Please tell me where people in your country go for vacations
these days.

How has the domestic travel of people in your country changed over the
years? Compare the difference in the ways of traveling in the past and
now. What kinds of activities do people usually do while traveling
today, and what things did people do in the past when they were on a
trip?

Traveling can lead to some interesting or unexpected experiences.
Describe a memorable trip you have taken. Where did you go, and what did
you see? Tell me what happened in detail.
