Let’s talk about where you live. What does your neighborhood look like?
Where is it located? What kinds of amenities are there in your
neighborhood? Tell me about a place around your house.

How has the place where you live changed or developed over the past ten
years? What was the city like, and what about now? Please tell me in as
much detail as possible.

Now, talk about an interesting or memorable experience in your
neighborhood. When and where did it occur? Why was it interesting or
memorable?
