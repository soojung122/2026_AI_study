You are looking for a new house. Call a real estate agency, and ask 3 or
4 questions about getting a house, and the list of the homes they have.

You just arrived at your new house. But you found out that a window is
broken. Contact a window repair shop, and leave a message about how the
window gets broken. Also, tell the person why you need to get it fixed
today.

Have you ever discovered something broken or damaged in your house? What
was that? How did it get broken, and how did you solve the problem? Tell
me the steps you took.

You indicated that you live in an apartment. Please describe your house
to me. What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Tell me in
detail.

Please tell me about the home you lived in when you were a child. How
was that home different from the home you live in now? Give me many
details.

What is your responsibility at home? What things do you usually do to
keep your house clean and comfortable? What is your role, and what are
the different responsibilities in your family? Tell me about it in
detail.
