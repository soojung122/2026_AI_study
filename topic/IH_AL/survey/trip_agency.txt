You are planning on going on a trip with your friend. Call a travel
agency, and ask 3 or 4 questions about the trip you want to go on.

For some reason, the travel agency informs you that the trip that you
wanted to go on is unavailable. Call your friend, leave a message to
explain the situation, and give 2 or 3 options to solve this problem.

Reflect back to the time when you had any problems while you were
planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with it?
Tell me what happened from beginning to end.
