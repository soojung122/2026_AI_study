I’d like to know about the bar you often go to. Where is your favorite
bar? What does it look like? Please describe everything about that bar
in detail.

How have bars changed over the last several years? What do you think
about the changes? How were they in the past, and what about now? What
are the differences and the similarities? Tell me all the changes in
detail.

Tell me about a memorable incident that happened at a bar. What exactly
happened, and why was it so special? How did you deal with it? Please
tell me everything about that incident in detail.
