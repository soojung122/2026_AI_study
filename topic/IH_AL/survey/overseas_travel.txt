Where do people in your country like to visit when they travel abroad?
Why do they like visiting those locations? What are the special reasons
they like to go to those areas? Tell me about it in detail.

What do you typically prepare before you travel internationally? What do
you do before the trip? What things do you usually bring in your
luggage? Please tell me what you do before going on a trip in detail.

Tell me about a memorable or unforgettable experience you had when you
took a trip abroad. Maybe something happened that was funny, unexpected,
challenging, or embarrassing. What happened, and how did you deal with
it? What made this experience so memorable? Use as many details as
possible to explain the whole story.
