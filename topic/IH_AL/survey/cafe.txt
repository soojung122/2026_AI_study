A new coffee shop has recently opened, and you want to grab some coffee
there. Call this café, and ask 3 or 4 questions about the menu and how
to order.

You got the wrong coffee that is not what you ordered. Contact the
coffee shop, explain the situation, and suggest 2 or 3 alternatives to
solve the problem.

Have you ever experienced that you ordered something and it was wrong?
What was the problem, and how did you deal with it? Tell me about the
experience in detail.

You indicated in the survey that you go to cafes or coffee shops. Tell
me about the café you often go to. Where is the café located? What does
it look like? Is there something special about that café?

When was the first time you went to a café? When was it? Who did you go
with? What do you remember the most about that café? Provide as many
details as possible.

Please tell me about a memorable experience you have had at a café. When
was it? Who were you with? What made this experience so special?
