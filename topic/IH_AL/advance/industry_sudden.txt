I’d like to know about the rising industries in your country. What
industries do people talk about these days? What is this industry about?
How has that industry changed over the years? How was it different
compared to the industry now?

Have the industry you just mentioned ever released a new product that
couldn’t meet people’s expectations? What was the product about? Why
were people disappointed about it? How did people react to this issue?
