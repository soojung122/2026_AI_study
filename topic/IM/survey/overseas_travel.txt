You indicated in the survey that you like to take vacations
internationally. Describe for me one of the countries or cities you’ve
visited recently. What does it look like? What are the people like
there? Explain it in detail.

I’m planning to go to Australia next month for a trip. Ask me 3 or 4
questions about my trip.

Where do people in your country go to when they travel abroad? Why do
they like visiting those locations? What is special about the countries
they visit?

Can you tell me all the things you do to prepare for trips? What do you
do before the trip? Please tell me everything.

Tell me about a memorable overseas trip. What did you do? Who did you go
with? What food did you eat? Please tell me about your experience in
detail.
