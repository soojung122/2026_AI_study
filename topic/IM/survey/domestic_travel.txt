You indicated in the survey that you like to take vacations
domestically. Tell me someplace you like to travel. Why do you like
going there?

Before you travel domestically, what do you usually prepare for your
trip? What items do you usually take with you? Tell me in detail.

Please tell me about some of the trips you took in your youth. Where did
you go? Why did you go there? Who did you go with? And what did you see
during that trip?
