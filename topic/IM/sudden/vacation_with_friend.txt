You are planning a vacation with one of your friends. Call a travel
agent to discuss the vacation you hope to go on. Ask 3 or 4 questions to
determine what things you need to do for this vacation.

I’m sorry, but there is a problem that you need to resolve. For some
reason, the travel agency informs you that the trip that you wanted to
go on is unavailable. Call your friend, leave a message to explain the
situation, and give 2 or 3 options to solve this problem.

Reflect back to the time when you had any problems while you were
planning a trip. What was the problem, and how did you deal with it?
Tell me what happened from beginning to end.
