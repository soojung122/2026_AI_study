I would like to talk about holidays. What kinds of holidays are there?
Please tell me a detailed description of holidays in your country.

What is the biggest holiday in your country? How do you celebrate it?
What do you do on that holiday? Tell me in detail.

Please tell me about the most memorable holiday you had in your
childhood. Where were you on that day? What did you do? Why is it so
memorable for you?
