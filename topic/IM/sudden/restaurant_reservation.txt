You’re planning to go to the restaurant this weekend with your friends.
Call the restaurant and book a table for you and your friends.

You forgot that you already made another appointment earlier with
another friend. Call your friend to explain and suggest two or three
options about this matter.

Tell me a memorable experience that you couldn’t keep a promise to your
family or friend, or had to cancel an appointment. What happened? What
was the reason you couldn’t keep a promise? How did you deal with the
situation?
